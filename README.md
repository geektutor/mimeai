# MIMEAI

Plant disease recognition mobile application built using flutter to help farmers know exactly what disease their plant might be suffering from. 

Currently the AI only recognizes 10 diseases in tomato plant, **lots of work still left to do**

## Getting Started

- get repo `git clone https://github.com/Tobenna-KA/mimeai.git`
- enter project director `cd mimeai`
- check flutter environment`flutter doctor`
- run app `flutter run`

The application separates the AI Model in a Python API located at [MIMEAI API](https://github.com/Tobenna-KA/mimeai-api)

Directives to the server you are running the API on can be set at [link](https://github.com/Tobenna-KA/mimeai/blob/70eabfc0c31abb1a78c5f25412224d7ef052fa38/lib/model/api.dart#L11)

**As I continue to find time, more features will be added**
